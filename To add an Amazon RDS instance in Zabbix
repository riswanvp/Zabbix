To add an Amazon RDS instance to Zabbix , you can follow these steps:

 


Install the Zabbix database monitoring plugin:


You can download the plugin from the official Zabbix website, and then install it on your Zabbix server by copying the plugin files to the /usr/lib/zabbix/plugins/ directory.
 

Configure the Zabbix database monitoring plugin:

To configure the plugin, you will need to create a new file named rds.cfg in the /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/ directory, and then add the following lines to it:

UserParameter=rds.discovery,/usr/lib/zabbix/plugins/rds.py discovery
UserParameter=rds.status[*],/usr/lib/zabbix/plugins/rds.py status $1
UserParameter=rds.performance[*],/usr/lib/zabbix/plugins/rds.py performance $1 $2
 

Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions:


To allow Zabbix to access your RDS instances, you will need to create an IAM role with the necessary permissions. The role should have the following policies attached to it:

AmazonRDSReadOnlyAccess
CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess
 

Add the IAM role to the Zabbix server: 

To add the IAM role to the Zabbix server, you will need to modify the Zabbix server configuration file (/etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf) and add the following line:


AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your_access_key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your_secret_key>
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<your_region>
Replace <your_access_key>, <your_secret_key>, and <your_region> with your own AWS access key ID, secret access key, and region.

 
Configure the RDS host in Zabbix:

To configure the RDS host in Zabbix, you will need to add it as a new host and then link it to the RDS template. The RDS template can be found in the Zabbix templates library.

 
Verify the RDS monitoring:


After completing the above steps, Zabbix should start monitoring your RDS instance. You can verify the monitoring data by going to the Monitoring â†’ Latest data page in the Zabbix web interface and selecting the RDS host.
